**Git:** Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in source code and is used for coordinating work among programmers during software development.

**GitHub:** GitHub is an online service that hosts software development and version-control using Git.

**Merge:** Merging in Git allows you to independent lines of development and combine them into a singular branch.

**Merge Conflict:** A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve difference between the code in two commits when merging and the programmer is required to determine which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

**Push:** A Git Push is used to upload content from a local repository to a remote repository.
